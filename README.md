NVIM setup :

- Uses Coc + Nvim 0.5 LSP for other plugins , this is still a work in process and 
    still being converted to lsp -> lua config as well. I will update this later on .
-  
- Uses theme from boo - which is quite nice and clean . Main plugins that are used is vista , coc lspsaga - pythonic based neovim setup 
- New version will be up soon

i3 config setup + polybar
- Use polybar with wedder to get personal weather infomation on top . 
- i3 resurect to get previous configs or layouts from before 
- Most of my main i3 config depends on the polybar layout  . 
- Binds may be very odd for most people , my keyboard is quite custom and hence that might be an issue .
